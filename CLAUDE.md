# Don't Go Broke

Personal finance PWA (single-user, public repo). Replicates core Copilot Money functionality.

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT use preview tools to verify changes.** The app requires authentication, so preview screenshots will always show the login page. Skip the verification workflow entirely.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4)
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Row Level Security)
- Plaid (bank sync — Sandbox for testing, Development for real banks, both free)
- Anthropic SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) for AI-generated financial insights (Claude Haiku)
- Recharts for data visualization (pie/donut charts, area charts)
- `@supabase/ssr` for auth (not the deprecated `auth-helpers-nextjs`)

## Key Architecture Decisions

- **Next.js 16 breaking changes**: `middleware.ts` is now `proxy.ts`. `cookies()`, `headers()`, `params` are async and must be awaited.
- **Auth**: Supabase magic link (passwordless). Session managed via cookies in `proxy.ts`.
- **Plaid**: All Plaid API calls are server-side only (`lib/plaid.ts` uses `server-only`). Access tokens are never returned to the client.
- **RLS**: Every table has Row Level Security. Most use `auth.uid() = user_id` policy. Exception: `securities` table is shared reference data with authenticated-user read/write policies (no `user_id` column).

## Design System

All styling goes through the design system. No hardcoded fonts, colors, or sizes in components.

- **Reference**: `style-guide.html` — living visual reference for all tokens and components
- **Tokens**: Defined in `app/globals.css` via Tailwind v4 `@theme inline`
- **Fonts**: DM Serif Display (`font-display`) + DM Sans (`font-body`), loaded via `next/font/google` in `app/layout.tsx`

### Key Tokens
- **Colors**: `sg-50`–`sg-900` (brand green), `neutral-50`–`neutral-900`, `danger-*`, `warning-*`
- **Number colors**: `sg-400` for positive, `danger-400` for negative
- **Type scale**: `text-hero` (47px/28px mobile), `text-display` (33px/24px), `text-heading` (22px/19px), `text-body` (20px/17px), `text-label` (17px/15px), `text-eyebrow` (16px), `text-number` (37px/28px), `text-mono` (19px/16px)
- **Radius**: `rounded-sm` (6px), `rounded-md` (10px), `rounded-lg` (16px), `rounded-xl` (24px)
- **Shadows**: `shadow-card`, `shadow-elevated`, `shadow-modal`

### Component Classes (in globals.css)
Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-ghost`, `.btn-danger`, `.btn-sm`, `.btn-lg`, `.btn-icon`), Inputs (`.input-field`, `.input-label`), Badges (`.badge`, `.badge-cat-*` for category tags), Cards (`.card`, `.card-elevated`, `.card-tinted`, `.card-dark`), Stat cards, Transaction rows (`.tx-row`, `.tx-amount.debit/.credit`), Progress bars, Tabs, Toggles, Avatars, Dividers, Empty states, Toasts, SpendBreakdown layout (`.spend-breakdown-layout`, `.spend-chart-wrap`, `.chart-container`, `.category-dropdown`), Collapse (`.collapse-section`, `.collapse-section.collapsed`, `.collapse-inner`)

**Note:** Sidebar and mobile layout classes (`.sidebar`, `.nav-link`, `.mobile-header`, `.sidebar-overlay`, `.sidebar-close`, `.main-content`) have been removed from globals.css — these components now use Tailwind utility classes directly.

### Rules
- **No hardcoded styles**: All colors, fonts, and sizes must use design system tokens or component classes
- **Page titles**: Use `text-hero font-display`
- **Update style-guide.html** when adding new tokens or components
- **Mobile-first responsive**: All responsive overrides live in a single `@media (max-width: 767px)` block at the bottom of `globals.css`. Breakpoint is 768px (matches Tailwind `md:`)
- **Animation easing**: Use `ease-out` for enter animations, `ease-in` for exit animations. Keep durations 150-300ms for micro-interactions.
- **Reduced motion**: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block at the end of `globals.css` disables all animations/transitions. All new animations are automatically covered.
- **Accessibility on alerts**: Use `role="alert"` on toast notifications and error boundary content so screen readers announce them.

## File Structure

- `proxy.ts` — Auth middleware (redirects unauthenticated users to /login)
- `lib/supabase/client.ts` — Browser Supabase client
- `lib/supabase/server.ts` — Server Supabase client (async, uses cookies)
- `lib/supabase/proxy.ts` — Supabase client for proxy/middleware context
- `lib/plaid.ts` — Server-only Plaid client singleton
- `lib/plaid-holdings.ts` — Server-only helper for syncing investment holdings from Plaid
- `lib/anthropic.ts` — Server-only Anthropic client factory (reads API key at call time due to Turbopack env quirk)
- `app/api/plaid/` — Three routes: create-link-token, exchange-token, sync (fetches up to 2 years of history, maps Plaid categories to custom categories, respects manual overrides, records daily net worth snapshots, syncs investment holdings)
- `app/api/accounts/disconnect/` — POST endpoint to disconnect an institution (cascades to accounts + transactions)
- `app/api/accounts/rename/` — POST endpoint to rename an account
- `app/api/transactions/update-category/` — POST endpoint for manual category overrides
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts` — Magic link callback (exchanges code for session)
- `app/globals.css` — Design system tokens + component classes + animations + reduced motion
- `app/error.tsx` — Root error boundary (client component with retry)
- `app/loading.tsx` — Root loading skeleton (animate-pulse)
- `app/*/error.tsx` — Per-route error boundaries (transactions, net-worth, accounts)
- `app/*/loading.tsx` — Per-route loading skeletons matching each page layout
- `app/api/insights/refresh/` — POST endpoint to delete today's cached insight (forces regeneration on next page load)
- `app/api/chat/` — POST endpoint for AI chatbot. Streams responses via SSE using Claude Haiku. Fetches accounts, transactions (90 days), net worth snapshots, and investment holdings as context. Deduplicates holdings and groups by account.
- `components/AppShell.tsx` — Layout wrapper (sidebar + main content, hidden on auth pages; mobile hamburger menu + drawer toggle; includes ChatWidget). Uses Tailwind utilities (no custom CSS classes). Mobile header uses deep sea green (`bg-sg-900`) to match sidebar.
- `components/Sidebar.tsx` — Navigation sidebar (Home, Transactions, Net Worth, Account Management). Slide-out drawer on mobile, fixed on desktop. Uses Tailwind utilities (no custom CSS classes). Deep sea green background (`bg-sg-900`), active nav items use `bg-sg-700 text-white` pill.
- `components/SpendBreakdown.tsx` — Donut chart of expenses by category (recharts). Filters out internal transfers (shown as excluded total). Groups small categories (<2%) into "Other" and caps at 6 slices max. Shows total in donut center. Used on `/transactions` page.
- `components/DonutChart.tsx` — Reusable rounded donut chart component (recharts PieChart with `paddingAngle` and `cornerRadius`). Takes `data` (name/value/color array) and `colors` props. Used on dashboard Spending by Category widget.
- `components/TransactionList.tsx` — Transaction list grouped by day, with colored category tags and inline category override dropdown
- `components/PlaidLinkButton.tsx` — Plaid Link integration button, passes institution_id for logo fetching
- `components/InstitutionLogo.tsx` — Renders Plaid institution logo (base64) with colored initials fallback
- `components/ChatWidget.tsx` — Floating chatbot widget (bottom-right). Expandable chat panel with streaming responses, markdown rendering (bold, italic, code, lists), suggested questions, and clear chat. Full-screen on mobile. Has enter/exit animations.
- `components/Toast.tsx` — Toast notification component + `useToast()` hook. Auto-dismisses after 4s. Uses existing `.toast` CSS classes. Add `role="alert"` for accessibility.

- `supabase/migrations/002_insights.sql` — Schema: insights (daily AI-generated financial insights, cached per user per day)
- `supabase/migrations/003_category_manual.sql` — Adds `category_manual` boolean to transactions
- `supabase/migrations/004_net_worth_snapshots.sql` — Schema: net_worth_snapshots (daily snapshots with assets, liabilities, net worth, account breakdown JSONB)
- `supabase/migrations/005_investment_holdings.sql` — Schema: securities (shared reference data), holdings (per-user investment positions)
- `supabase/migrations/006_institution_logos.sql` — Adds institution_id and institution_logo to plaid_items
- `supabase/migrations/007_credit_limit.sql` — Adds credit_limit to accounts

## Pages

- `/` — Home dashboard with multiple rows: (1) Summary cards row — 4 cards (Total Balance with sea green gradient, Income with trend icon, Expenses with trend icon, Net Savings) in a 4-column grid (2x2 on mobile). (2) My Cards + Monthly Trend row — hardcoded credit cards widget (Amex Gold, Capital One Venture X) with card switcher on left (3fr), weekly expense area chart on right (7fr). (3) Recent Transactions + Spending by Category row — 3 latest transactions with colored initials and "View all" link on left (6fr), rounded donut chart with category legend on right (4fr). (4) Category spend pill selector + top/worst investment performer cards. AI insight card with Claude orange accent at top.
- `/transactions` — Transaction list grouped by day, inline month pagination arrows with slide animation, auto-syncs on load, clickable category tags for manual override with animated dropdown. Sync and category errors show toasts; category changes roll back on failure.
- `/accounts` — Account management: connected institutions with logos, account/institution count summary pills, neutral-styled disconnect buttons, sync. Refreshes immediately after new institution connected. Sync and disconnect errors show toasts.
- `/net-worth` — Net worth tracker: total net worth hero, assets vs liabilities stats, area chart of net worth over time with gradient fill (from daily snapshots). Account breakdown grouped by type in animated collapsible sections (CSS grid trick) with institution logos, balance, and change % (or utilization % for credit cards). Investment/brokerage accounts are clickable and open a slide-up sheet showing account detail, mini chart, and individual holdings (ticker, name, shares, value, gain/loss). Snapshots recorded on each Plaid sync, one per day (upserted).
- `/login` — Magic link auth (no sidebar)

## Categories

Custom category system (not Plaid's raw categories). Plaid categories are mapped during sync via `PLAID_TO_CATEGORY` in the sync route.

**Categories**: Income, Rent, Utilities, Restaurants, Groceries, Shopping, Travel, Bars and nightlife, Entertainment, Transportation, Gym, Personal care, Health, Internal transfer, Other

**Category colors**: Each category has a matching badge class (`badge-cat-*` in globals.css) and pie chart color (`CATEGORY_COLORS` in SpendBreakdown.tsx). When adding a new category, update both.

**Manual overrides**: Users can click a category tag to change it. Manual overrides set `category_manual = true` in the DB, which prevents sync from overwriting the category.

## Security (CRITICAL — READ THIS FIRST)

Security is the #1 priority in every change to this codebase. The GitHub repo is public, but the app handles real financial data. Every PR, every feature, every refactor must be evaluated through a security lens first. When in doubt, choose the more secure option.

### Non-Negotiable Rules

- **Secrets**: All secrets live in `.env.local` (git-ignored). `.env.example` has placeholders only. Before every commit, verify no real keys, tokens, or credentials are included.
- **Server-only**: Plaid access tokens, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `PLAID_SECRET`, and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` must NEVER be exposed to the client. Any file using these must import `server-only` or be an API route.
- **RLS always on**: Every new table must have Row Level Security enabled with `auth.uid() = user_id` policies before any data is written. No exceptions.
- **Session verification**: Every API route must verify the user session before executing. Never trust client-side data without server-side validation.
- **No `NEXT_PUBLIC_` on secrets**: Only `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` may have the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix. Everything else is server-only.
- **Generic errors**: Never return stack traces, Supabase errors, or Plaid error details to the client. Return generic error messages only.
- **Git hygiene**: Never commit database dumps, seed files with real data, Plaid tokens, or Supabase access tokens. Run `git log --all -- .env.local` to verify before pushing.

## Commands
